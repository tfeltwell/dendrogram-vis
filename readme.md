# Dendrogram Visualisation

Using [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) to plot the nodes of a dendrogram, with the aim of creating interactive dendrograms, with leaves linking to heatmaps they represent. 

Currently in very early stages of dev.

## To-Do
- Remove all of the vis.js shit so we've only got required js and css files
- Parse JSON data so we get sets of coords
